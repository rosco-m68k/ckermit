# C-Kermit Protocol Module 9.0.160, 16 Oct 2009

This is a fork of C-Kermit 9 that has been updated to build on modern
Ubuntu (Tested with 20.04). It exists here only to support the 
rosco_m68k project, and should probably not be considered generally 
useful.

If you are using a Red Hat distribution, it is likely that you can install
an official Kermit with `yum`.

If you are on macOS, you can get an 'official' kermit from homebrew.
